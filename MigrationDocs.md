# Read before migration file creation, editing, etc

## Main rules
- Do not duplicate version numbers

- Version numbers must be sequential, the newest file must have a larger number than the previous

- To edit a table, ***do not edit a previous file***! This will do nothing, so a new file must be created in order to execute new/edited commands

- When collaboratively coding, check with your collaborators to see the version numbers in use. Use rules 1 and 2 to see what to do
